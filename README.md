# QuickSortProject

Given a list of the number of pages in all the books in the school library, and a maximum limit of
the number of pages you are willing to read, determine the maximum number of books you can
fully read!

This solution implements the Quick Sort algortihm to sort the list of book pages from smallest to highest
then return the number of books that can be read after adding up all the pages until it reaches the maximum number of pages or run out of books (whichever first).
